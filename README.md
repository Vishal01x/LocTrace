# Location Tracking App
This Android application, built using Kotlin and XML, allows company employers (admins) to track the real-time locations of their employees. The app also visualizes the routes taken by employees using polylines on Google Maps. This project leverages GeoFire, Google Maps SDK, Directions API, and Firebase to provide a robust location tracking solution.

## Features
* Admin and Employee Roles: Admins can monitor the location of their employees.
* Real-Time Location Tracking: Track the live locations of employees using GeoFire.
* Route Visualization: Display the routes taken by employees on the map using polylines.
* Firebase Integration: Secure data storage and real-time database operations using Firebase.
## Technologies Used
* Kotlin: For Android app development.
* XML: For designing the user interface.
* GeoFire: For real-time location tracking.
* Google Maps SDK: For map functionalities and displaying locations.
* Directions API: For generating and displaying routes.
* Firebase: For database and authentication services.
